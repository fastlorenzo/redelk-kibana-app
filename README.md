# Kibana app for RedELK

This application serves as a companion app for [RedELK](https://github.com/outflanknl/redelk).

The objective is to add manual actions to ingest data.

Currently, working functionalities are:
- Manual ingestion of IOC (file type only)
- Display stats on summary page + link to RedELK dashboards

This application is compatible with Elastic stack v7.9.2+
